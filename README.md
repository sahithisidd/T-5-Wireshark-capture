# Network Traffic Capture & Analysis Report  
**Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark**  

---

## 1. Objective  
The goal of this task was to get hands-on with Wireshark, capture some live network packets, and figure out which protocols were actually being used in real time while I was online. This wasn’t just about clicking “start” and “stop” — it was about watching the raw conversation happening between my computer and the rest of the internet.
